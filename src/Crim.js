    "text": "6.   Tonito, an 8-year-old boy, was watching a free concert at the Luneta Park with his father Tony.\nThe child stood on a chair to be able to see the performers on the stage.  Juanito, a 10-year-old boy, who was also watching the concert, could not see much of the performance on the stage because Tonito was blocking his line of sight by standing on the chair. Using his elbow, Juanito\nstrongly shoved Tonito to get a good view of the stage.  The shove caused Tonito to fall to the ground. Seeing this, Tony struck Juanito on the head with his hand and caused the boy to fall and to hit his head on a chair. Tony also wanted to strangle Juanito but the latter’s aunt prevented him from doing so. Juanito sustained a lacerated wound on the head that required medical attendance for 10 days.\n\nTony was charged with child abuse in violation of Sec. 10(a), in relation to Sec. 3(b)(2), of R.A.\n7610 (Child Abuse Law) for allegedly doing an “act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or\ndemeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.” In his defense, Tony\ncontended that he had no intention to maltreat Juanito, much less to degrade his intrinsic worth\nand dignity as a human being. (2017 Bar Question)\n\nA)  Distinguish crimes mala in se from crimes mala prohibita.\nB)  Was Tony criminally liable for child abuse under R.A. 7610? Explain your answer.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Mala in se and mala prohibita are distinguished as follows: (1) Mala in se are inherently wrong or immoral, while mala prohibita are only wrong because they are prohibited by law; (2) In mala in se, good faith or lack of criminal intent is a defense, while in mala prohibita, it is not; (3) Modifying circumstances can be appreciated in mala in se, while in mala prohibita it cannot be appreciated unless the special law adopts the technical nomenclature of the penalties of the Revised Penal Code; (4) Mala in se are punishable under the Revised Penal Code; or special laws where the acts punishable therein are wrong by nature. Mala prohibita are punishable under special laws\n\nB)  No, Tony is not criminally liable since he neither laid hands on Juanito with the intent to debase the latter’s \"intrinsic worth and dignity\" as a human being, nor did he intend to humiliate or embarrass Juanito, which is essential in the crime of child abuse under R.A. 7610.\n\nIt appears that the laying of hands on Juanito had been done at the spur of the moment and in anger;\nhence, the crime committed is only slight physical injuries\n\n"

AA duly collected the placement fee from complainant. As per certification of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, AA did not possess any authority or license for overseas employment. Is it\n\nproper to file two (2) separate Informations for illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and for estafa by means of deceit? (2012 Bar Question)\n\nA)  No. The filing of two (2) separate Informations for illegal recruitment under the Labor Code and for estafa by means of deceit for the same act is violative of the principle against double jeopardy.\nB)  No. One Information for a complex crime of illegal recruitment with estafa by means of deceit should be filed, instead of two (2) separate Informations.\nC)  No. A person convicted of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code may not, for the same act, be separately convicted of estafa by means of deceit.\nD) Yes. A person convicted of illegal recruitment under the Labor Code may, for the same act, be separately convicted of estafa by means of deceit.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nD. it is well-settled that a person who has committed illegal recruitment may be charged and convicted separately of the crime of illegal recruitment under RA No. 8042 and estafa since the crime of illegal recruitment is malum prohibitum, while estafa is malum in se.\n\nMoreover, although the two crimes may arise from the same facts, they are not the same. Not all acts, which constitute estafa, necessarily establish illegal recruitment, for estafa is wider in scope and covers deceits whether or not related to recruitment activities. More importantly, the element of damage, which is essential in estafa case, is immaterial in illegal recruitment\n\nFurther, under Section 6 of RA No. 8042 as amended by RA No. 10022, the filing of an offense punishable under this Act shall be without prejudice to the filing of cases punishable under existing laws, rules or regulations. If the recruitment is undertaken to defraud another, the recruiter may be held liable for estafa under paragraph 2(a) of Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code and illegal recruitment\n\n"

He wants to make the State prison a revenue earner for the country through a law providing for premium accommodations for prisoners (other than those under maximum security status) whose wives are allowed conjugal weekend visits, and for those who want long-term premium accommodations.\n\nFor conjugal weekenders, he plans to rent out rooms with hotel-like amenities at rates equivalent\n\nto those charged by 4-star hotels; for long-term occupants, he is prepared to offer room and board with special meals in air conditioned single- occupancy rooms, at rates equivalent to those charged by 3-star hotels.\n\nWhat advice will you give the Senator from the point of view of criminal law, taking into account the purpose of imprisonment (7%) and considerations of ethics and morality (3%)? (2013 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nI would advise Senator Salcedo to abandon his proposed bill as it will result in economic inequality in the field of criminal justice. The bill runs afoul with the equal protection clause of the 1987 Constitution which does not merely bar the creation of inequalities but commands, as well, the elimination of existing inequalities.\n\nAdditionally, the purpose of imposing penalties, which is to secure justice, retribution and reformation, will be defeated should the bill eventually become a law.\n\n"

While on board the vessel, he saw his mortal enemy Iason, also an Indonesian national, seated at the back portion of the cabin and who was busy reading a newspaper. Ando stealthily approached Iason and when he was near him, Ando stabbed and killed Iason. The vessel is registered in Malaysia. The killing happened just a few moments after the vessel left the port of Manila. Operatives from the PNP Maritime Command arrested Ando. Presented for the killing of Iason, Ando contended that he did not incur criminal liability because both he and the victim were Indonesians. He likewise argued that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian-registered ship. Discuss the merits of Ando's contentions. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nBoth contentions of Ando lack merit.\n\nFirstly, under the generality principle, penal laws shall be obligatory upon all who live or sojourn in the Philippines territory, except as provided in treaties and laws of preferential application. Thus, the fact that Ando is an Indonesian does not exclude him from the operation of penal laws.\n\nSecondly, the contention of Ando that he could not be prosecuted in Manila because the vessel is a Malaysian-registered ship is without merit, as under the English Rule, which our jurisdiction recognizes and follows, crimes committed aboard a vessel within the territorial waters of a country are triable in the courts\n\nof such country except when the crimes merely affect things within the vessel or when they only refer to the internal management thereof. Hence, Ando may be prosecuted in Manila.\n\nADDITIONAL ANSWER:\n\nUnder Section 27 of the Convention of the Law of the Sea, the criminal jurisdiction of the coastal State should not be exercised on board a foreign ship passing through the territorial sea in connection with any crime committed on board except, if the crime is of a kind to disturb the peace of the country or the good order of the territorial sea.\n\n"

(2012 Bar Question)\nA)  No. The evil intent of the offender cannot be accomplished.\n\nB)  No. An attempt to commit light felony constitutes an employment of inadequate or ineffectual means.\nC)  No. The penalty for consummated light felony is less than the penalty for impossible crime. D) No. In impossible crime, the act performed should not constitute a violation of another\noffense. SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nA. The penalty for impossible crime is arresto mayor or a fine from 200 to 500 pesos (Article 59 of the Revised Penal Code) while the penalty for light felony is arresto menor or a fine not exceeding P200 or both.\n\nArticle 59 should not be made applicable to one who attempts to commit a light felony of impossible materialization since the penalty for the former is graver than that for the latter.

Thinking that he could marry Celia if Wilma were to die, Honesto decided to kill Wilma. He secretly followed Wilma for weeks to learn her daily routine. He decided to kill her at night on her way home. On the night he was to kill Wilma, Honesto wore dark clothes so that he would not be easily seen. He waited in the dark alley for Wilma to pass by.

Some bystanders who heard the shot were able to stop Honesto.\n\nIt turned out that Wilma did not report for work on that day, and the one who was shot in the head was Melba, who died. The passerby whose arm was grazed by the bullet required medical attendance for two days. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nA)  What crime(s) did Honesto commit? Explain.\n\nB)  Will your answer be the same, assuming that the other passerby was hit in the left eye which caused his/her blindness? Explain.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Honesto is liable for murder qualified by the circumstance of treachery for killing Melba due to error in personae or mistake of identity, and slight physical injuries for the wound sustained by the passerby due to aberratio ictus or mistake of blow.\nThis is because although his intention was to commit parricide, the murder and slight physical injuries are the direct, natural and logical consequence of the act he committed.\n\nB)  No, if the passerby was hit in the left eye causing blindness, the crime committed by Honesto is Murder with Serious Physical Injuries. Serious physical injuries may be made a component of a complex crime under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code. Thus, since a single act of shooting the victim constitutes murder, and serious physical injuries, Article 48 may be applied.\n\n"

(2014 Bar Question)\n\nA)  What crime, if any, did Puti commit?\nB)   Would your answer be the same if, as a result of the mixture, Pula got an upset stomach and\nhad to be hospitalized for 10 days?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)   Puti committed the impossible crime of murder given that all the elements are present: the act was committed with the intent to kill; the act would have resulted to murder, which is a crime against persons; and the crime was not accomplished because the solution turned out to be non-toxic, hence, the employment of ineffectual means.\n\nB)\tNo, if as a result of the mixture, Pula got an upset stomach and had to be hospitalized for 10 days, the crime committed by Puti is Less Serious Physical Injuries and not an impossible crime because the last element of an impossible crime requires the act does not constitute a violation of another provision of the RPC.\n\n"

Enrique wrote a ransom note demanding that Carla’s parents pay him P500,000.00 ransom in exchange for her liberty. However, before the ransom note could be received by Carla’s parents, Enrique’s hideout was discovered by the police. Carla was rescued while Enrique was arrested. The prosecutor considered that the ransom note was never received by Carla’s parents and filed a case of “Impossible crime to commit kidnapping” against Enrique.\n\nIs the prosecutor correct? If he is not correct, can he instead file a case of grave coercion? (2014\nBar Question)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe Prosecutor is not correct because there is no “Impossible crime to commit kidnapping”. This is because kidnapping is a Crime against Personal Liberty and Security. Also, even if the ransom note was not received by Carla’s parents, under the RPC, the crime of kidnapping and serious illegal detention for ransom is consummated upon the extortion of ransom regardless if the ransom note was received or that ransom was paid.\n\nLastly, the Prosecutor cannot file a case of grave coercion because the crime committed, as explained above, is kidnapping for ransom.\n\n"

One day, while shopping in a mall, he saw a group of shoppers whom he thought were the assassins who were out to kill him. He asked for the gun of his escort and shot ten (10) people and wounded five (5) others before he was subdued. The wounded persons required more than thirty (30) days of medical treatment. What crime or crimes, if any, did he commit? Explain.

The intent to kill can be seen in the nature of the weapon used and extent of the wounds sustained by the five victims. Treachery also qualified the crime to murder since the sudden attack rendered the victims defenseless.

During the nationwide transport strike to protest the phase out of old public utility vehicles, striking jeepney drivers Percy, Pablo, Pater and Sencio, each armed with guns, hailed several MMDA buses then providing free transport to the stranded public to stop them from plying their routes.  They later on commandeered one of the buses without allowing any of the passengers to alight, and told the driver to bring the bus to Tanay, Rizal.\n\nUpon reaching a remote area in Tanay, Percy, Pablo, Pater and Sencio Forcibly divested the Passengers of their cash and valuables. They ordered the passengers to leave thereafter.  Then, they burned the bus.  When a tanod of the barangay of the area came around to intervene, Pater fired at him, instantly killing him.\n\n\nAfter Percy, Pablo, Pater and Sencio were arrested, the police authorities recommended them to be charged with the following crimes, to wit: (1) carnapping; (2) robbery; (3) direct assault with homicide; (4) kidnapping; and (5) arson. State your legal opinion on the recommendation of the police authorities on the criminal liabilities incurred by Percy, Pablo, Pater and Sencio. (2017 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nPercy, Pablo, Pater and Sencio committed the crime Robbery for having commandeered the bus for purpose of robbing the passengers. Moreover, since the taking of the victims was merely to commit robbery and not to transport them to another place for purpose of detention, the crime committed is not kidnapping, but robbery.\n\nMoreover, since the death of the Barangay Tanod resulted by reason or on occasion of robbery, the crime committed is a special complex crime of robbery with homicide. Also, even though only Pater killed the Tanod, Percy, Pablo, and Sencio are also liable for robbery with homicide since they failed to attempt to prevent the same.\n\nAdditionally, since the crime committed is robbery with homicide, all other felonies such as arson and direct assault committed by reason or on occasion of robbery shall be integrated into the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.\n\nFurther, since the accused unlawfully took an MMDA bus without the consent of its owner, giving rise to the presumption of their intent to gain, it appears that all of the elements of carnapping are present, namely: (a) the taking of the motor vehicle which belongs to another; (b) the taking is without consent of the owner or by means of violence against or intimidation of persons or by using force upon things; and (c) the taking is done with intent to gain.

What crime or crimes, if any, did the four malefactors commit? (2.5%)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Pedro, Pablito and Juan are liable for robbery by band, whereas Julio is liable for special complex crime of robbery with rape.\n\nJulio’s liability arose when he raped the daughter of Antonio on the occasion or by reason of robbery. Even if the place of robbery is different from that of rape, given the direct connection between the two crimes the crime is still special complex crime of robbery with rape.\n\nPedro, Pablito and Juan are liable for robbery by band. There is a band in this case since more than three armed malefactors took part in the commission of a robbery, and following Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code, any member of a band, who is present at the commission of a robbery by the\n\nband, shall be punished as principal of any of the assaults committed by the band, unless it be shown that he attempted to prevent the same. They are not liable, however, for rape since they were not present when the victim was raped and thus, they had no opportunity to prevent the same.\n\nB)  The four shall all be liable for a special complex crime of robbery with homicide.

Porthos, displaying fearlessness, aggressively shouted back at Aramis: Wag kang magtapang-tapangan dyan, papatayin kita!  Without saying anything more, Aramis drew his gun from his waist and shot Porthos in the leg.  Porthos’ wound was not life threatening. . (2017 Bar Question)\n\nA)   What are the kinds of unlawful aggression, and which kind was displayed in this case? Explain your answer.\n\nB)   Standing  trial  for  frustrated murder, Aramis  pleaded  self-defense.    The  Prosecution’s contention was that the plea of self-defense applied only to consummated killings. Rule, with explanations, on the tenability of Arami’s claim of self-defense, and on the Prosecution’s contention.\n\nC)   Porthos insisted that the element of treachery was present.  To rule out treachery, Aramis asserted that both he and Porthos were then facing and confronting each other when he fired the shot. Rule, with reasons, on the respective contentions.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Unlawful aggression is of two kinds: (a) actual or material unlawful aggression, which involves an attack with physical force or with a weapon; and (b) imminent unlawful aggression which refers to an attack that is impending or at the point of happening, and not merely threatening attitude.\n\nIn this case, there is neither actual nor imminent unlawful aggression. The statement “papatayin kita” neither constitutes an attack with physical force or with a weapon, nor an impending attack, which is offensive and positively strong.\n\nB) The prosecution’s contention is not tenable as the claim of self-defense is not confined to consummated killing. Shooting the leg of the victim without killing him may be considered as reasonable means to prevent or repel an actual or imminent unlawful aggression; hence, Arami’s claim of self-defense is tenable.\n\nC)  There is no treachery given that the attack was preceded by heated words. The sudden attack was not preconceived and deliberately adopted but was just triggered by the sudden infuriation on the part of the accused, because of the provocative act of the victim, where their meeting was purely accidental.\n\n"

(2009 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nDwelling is aggravating because the crimes were committed in Loretta’s room which in law, is considered as her dwelling. It is well settled that “dwelling” includes a room in a boarding house being occupied by the offended party where she enjoys privacy, peace of mind and sanctity of an abode.\n\nNocturnity or nighttime is also aggravating because pursuant to the objective test, although nighttime was not purposely or especially sought for by Wenceslao, it was obviously taken advantage of by him in committing the other crimes.\n\nThe use of a picklock to enter the room of the victim is not an aggravating circumstance under Art. 14 of the Code as the same is punished as a crime by itself, where the offender has no lawful cause for possessing it.

Bruno, on the other hand, successfully proved that he voluntarily surrendered to the authorities; that he pleaded guilty to the crime charged; that it was the victim who first attacked and did so without any provocation on his (Bruno's) part, but he prevailed because he managed to draw his knife with which he stabbed the victim. The penalty for homicide is reclusion temporal.\n\nAssuming a judgment of conviction and after considering the attendant circumstances, what penalty should the judge impose? (2013 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe judge should impose an indeterminate sentence penalty of arresto mayor in any of its period to prision correccional  in  its  medium  period  as  maximum since  Bruno  is  entitled  to  two  privileged  mitigating circumstances which lowered the prescribed penalty for homicide.\n\nThere is incomplete self-defense since there is no reasonable necessity of the means employed by Bruno when he used a knife to stab the weaponless victim. Moreover, there are no aggravating circumstances present, and at least two mitigating circumstances, namely, voluntary surrender and plea of guilt.\n\nThere are also no aggravating circumstances present, because it was not shown that Bruno disregarded the age of the victim or that nighttime facilitated the commission of the crime; moreover, dwelling cannot be appreciated because the crime happened in the house where both Bruno and the victim lived.\n\n\n\n"

B)  Supposing the trial judge imposes a straight penalty of imprisonment for one year. Is the\npenalty correct in the context of the Indeterminate Sentence Law? Explain your answer.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Under the second part of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, in cases where the offense is punishable under special law, the maximum indeterminate penalty shall not exceed the maximum limit of the prescribed penalty, while the minimum penalty shall not be less than the minimum limit thereof. However, if the special law adopts the technical nomenclature of the penalties under the Revised Penal Code, the provision of the Revised Penal Code will apply.\n\nThus, Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code shall apply. The maximum penalty shall be fixed within the range of the proper imposable period after taking into consideration the modifying circumstance; while the minimum penalty shall be fixed within the range of the penalty next lower in degree than that prescribed by law.\n\nIn this case, the minimum indeterminate sentence must be taken from arresto mayor and the maximum from any of the periods of prision correccional.\n\nB)  Yes, since Sammy Peke made a confession, the penalty of prision correccional prescribed for selling fake book shall be applied in its minimum period, which ranges from 6 months and 1 day to 2 years and 4 months. Thus, the court may opt to impose a penalty of 1 year of imprisonment within the range of the minimum period of prision correccional, as this is favorable to the accused based on the ruling of the Supreme Court in People of the Philippines v.

Even if reclusion perpetua is a single indivisible penalty, the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority would still be considered to lower the imposable penalty. The rule in Article 63, RPC that if the penalty prescribed by law is a single indivisible penalty, it shall be imposed regardless of mitigating and aggravating circumstance refers only to ordinary mitigating circumstances.\n\nB)  Yes. The Indeterminate Sentence Law is applicable even to special penal laws. Since life imprisonment was converted into reclusion perpetua, which in turn was graduated to reclusion temporal because of the privileged mitigating circumstance of minority, the Indeterminate Sentence Law is applicable.\n\nC)  Yes. A may still file an application for probation even if he filed a notice of appeal. Section 42, RA\n9344 allows a child in conflict with the law to apply for probation with the court “any time.” This\nmeans that he may do so even beyond the period for perfecting an appeal and even if the child has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction.\n\nD)  If probation is not allowed by the court, the minor offender shall serve his sentence in agricultural camp or other training facility in accordance with Section 51 of RA 9344 as amended.\n\n"

Acting as lookout, C had already opened the main door of the house when the helper was awakened by the pleading of G to A and B to just take the money from the vault without harming her. When the helper shouted for help upon seeing G with A and B inside the room, B stabbed G and ran towards the door, leaving the house with C. A also left the house after taking the money of G from the vault. G was brought to the hospital where she died as a result of the wound inflicted by B. Under the given facts, are A, B and C exempt from criminal liability? If not, what is the proper charge against them or any of them? (2012 Bar Question)\nA)  A, B and C, being under eighteen (18) years of age at the time of the commission of the offense, are exempt from criminal liability and should be merely subjected to intervention program for child in conflict with the law.\n\nB)  There being no indication of having acted with discernment, A, B and C are exempt from criminal liability, subject to appropriate programs in consultation with the person having custody over the child in conflict with the taw or the local social welfare and development officer.\nC)  Considering the given facts which manifest discernment, A, B and C are not exempt from criminal liability and should be charged with the complex crime of robbery with homicide, subject to automatic suspension of sentence upon finding of guilt.\nD) Under the given facts, A, B and C are not exempt from criminal liability because they\nconspired to commit robbery for which they should be collectively charged as principals, and in addition, B should be separately charged with homicide for the death of G, subject to diversion programs for children over 15 and under 18 who acted with discernment.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nC.

In a single act of attacking Judge Samsonite, he committed two crimes, direct assault and murder. The two crimes may be complexed under Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\n(1) The circumstance of disregard of rank shall be absorbed because it is inherent element of the crime of direct assault.\n\n(2) The circumstance of disregard of age is not present in this case because Bernardo’s attack was not for the purpose of offending or insulting Judge Samsonite’s age. (People v. Onabia, G.R. No. 128288, Apr. 20,\n1999).\n\n(3) The circumstance of dwelling maybe appreciated as an aggravating circumstance because Judge Samsonite was  attacked in  the house of  his mistress, where he  regularly slept. In  the aggravating circumstance of dwelling, the victim need not be the owner of the dwelling place, but as the owner’s invited guest, he, the stranger, is sheltered by the same roof and protected by the same intimacy it affords. He is entitled to respect even for that short moment. (People v. Balansi, G.R. No. 77284, 19 July 1990).\n\n(4) The circumstance nighttime shall not be appreciated because the presence of treachery in the instant case absorbs this aggravating circumstance (People v. Pagador, G.R. No. 140006-10, April 20, 2001).\n\n(5) The circumstance of cruelty may not also be appreciated because the infliction of several stab wounds by the perpetrator was not shown to be for the purpose of exacerbating the pain and suffering of the victim. The number of wounds inflicted on the victim is not proof of cruelty (Simangan v. People, G.R. No.\n157984, July 8, 2004).\n\n(6) Bernardo is also not a quasi-recidivist because he committed the crime while the judgement of conviction is on appeal. A quasi-recidivist is someone who shall commit a felony after having been convicted by final judgment, before beginning to serve such sentence, or while serving the same (Article\n160 of the Revised Penal Code).\n\n"

Edri, the guard in charge who had been receiving gifts from Brusco everytime he visited Dancio, became friendly with him and became relaxed in the inspection of his belongings during his jail visits. In one of Brusco's visits, he was able to smuggle in a pistol which Dancio used to disarm the guards and destroy the padlock of the main gate of the jail, enabling Dancio to escape. What crime(s) did Dancio, Brusco and Edri commit?  Explain. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nDancio committed the crime of direct assault under Article 148 of the Revised Penal Code for disarming the guards with the use of pistol while they are engaged in the performance of their duties.\n\nEdri committed infidelity in the custody of prisoner or evasion through negligence under Article 224 of the RPC. As the guard in charge, Edri was negligent in relaxing the inspection of the Brusco’s belongings during jail visits allowing him to smuggle a pistol to Dencio, which he subsequently used to escape. Edri also committed indirect bribery under Article 211 of the Revised Penal Code by accepting gifts from Brusco, who was part of the syndicate to which Dancio belonged.\n\nBrusco committed delivery of prisoner from jail under Article 156 of the Revised Penal Code, as well as bribery under Article 210 of the same Code. Helping a person confined in jail to escape constitutes this crime, and by providing Dencio with a pistol, he helped him escape.\n\n"

When Frank failed to pay despite demand, Eric filed a complaint against him for violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 22 (The Bouncing Checks Law).\n\nWas the charge brought against Frank correct? (2013 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nYes, the charge of Violation of BP 22 is correct. Being malum prohibitum, it is committed by mere issuance\nof a worthless check, and the conditions relating to the issuance are irrelevant to the prosecution of the\noffender. Frank’s request to defer the deposit of the check as it has insufficient funds will not militate against his prosecution for BP Blg. 22.\n\n"

    "text": "205.\tSixteen year old Aliswan prodded Ametyst, his girlfriend, to remove her clothing while they were secretly together in her bedroom late one evening.  Failing to get a positive response from her, he forcibly undressed her.  Apprehensive about rousing the attention of the household who did not know of his presence inside her room, she resisted him with minimal strength, but she was really sobbing in a muffled manner. He then undressed himself while blocking the door. Yet, the image of a hapless and sobbing Amethyst soon brought him to his senses, and impelled him to leave her room naked.  He did not notice in his hurry that Amante, the father of Amethyst, who was then sitting alone on a sofa in the sala, saw him leave his daughter’s room naked.\n\nOutside the house, the now-clothed Aliswan spotted Allesso, Amethyst’s former suitor. Knowing how  Allesso  had  aggressively pursued Amethyst, Aliswan fatally  stabbed Allesso.    Aliswan immediately went into hiding afterwards.\n\nUpon learning from Amethyst about what Aliswan had done to her, an enraged Amante wanted to teach Aliswan a lesson he would never forget. Amante set out the next day to look for Aliswan in his school.  There, Amante found a young man who looked very much like Aliswan.  Amante immediately rushed and knocked the young man unconscious on the pavement, and then draped his body with a prepared tarpaulin reading RAPIST AKO HUWAG TULARAN. Everyone else in the school was shocked upon witnessing what had just transpired, unable to believe that the timid and quiet Alisto, Aliswan’s identical twin brother, had committed rape. (2017 Bar Question)\n\nA)  A criminal complaint for attempted rape with homicide was brought against Aliswan in the Prosecutor’s Office.  However, after preliminary investigation, the Investigating Prosecutor recommended the filing of two separate informations – one for attempted rape and the other for homicide. Do you agree with the recommendation? Explain your answer.\n\nB)  Before the trial court, Aliswan moved that the cases should be dismissed because he was entitled to the exempting circumstance of minority.  Is his motion correct?   Explain your answer.\n\nC)  After receiving medical attendance for 10 days, Alisto consulted you about filing the proper criminal complaint against Amante. What crimes, if any, will you charge Amante with? Explain your answer.\n\nD) Answering the criminal complaint filed by Alisto, Amante contended that he had incurred no criminal liability for lack of criminal intent on his part, his intended victim being Aliswan, not Alisto. What is this defense of Amante, and explain if the same will prosper?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  I disagree with the charge of attempted rape, while I agree on the separate crime of homicide.\n\nI do not agree with the charge of attempted rape because of the failure to show that Aliswan had done acts to have sex with Amethyst. Undressing the victim with lewd design merely constitutes acts of lasciviousness [People v. Sanico, (G.R. No. 208469, Aug. 13, 2014)].\n\nI agree with the separate charge of homicide because the homicide is not even connected with the acts of lasciviousness. Homicide was committed motivated by a personal grudge of Aliswan against Alesso, which has no link to the crime of acts of lasciviousness against Amethyst.\n\nB)  Since Aliswan’s age is above 15 but below 18, being the twin brother of 16 year old Aliswan, the exempting circumstance of minority shall be appreciated in his favor unless it is shown that he acted with discernment.\n\nC)  Amante shall be charged with Less Serious Physical Injuries under Art. 265 of the Revised Penal Code because he needed medical attendance for a period of ten (10) days only.\n\nHowever, the circumstance of adding ignominy to the offense shall be appreciated to add the penalty of a fine not exceeding Php500.00 because the injuries were inflicted to insult or offend the offended party.\n\nD)  The defense raised by Amante is error in personae. This defense is not proper because of Article 4 of the Revised Penal Code, which provides that a person committing a felony is liable criminally although the wrongful act done be different from unlawful intent. Thus, under this provision, Amante is liable for the wrongful act done, and that is child abuse against Alisto, although it differs from the wrongful act intended, and that is abusing Aliswan.\n\n"

In a fit of rage, Jojo retrieved his revolver from inside the bedroom cabinet and shot Alma, immediately killing her. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nA)  Is Art. 247 (death or physical injuries inflicted under exceptional circumstances) of the Revised Penal\nCode applicable in this case given that the paramour was of the same gender as the erring spouse?\nB)  Is Felipa liable for adultery for having sexual relations with Alma? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nA)  No, Article. 247 of the Revised Penal Code is not applicable because the offender must catch his or her spouse in the act of committing sexual intercourse with another person.\n\nSexual intercourse presupposes the penetration of the man’s sexual organ into that of a woman’s. In this case, the paramour was of the same gender as the erring spouse. As such, there is legally, no sexual intercourse to speak of, hence, Art. 247 is not applicable.\n\nB)  No. Under Article 333 of the Revised Penal Code, adultery is committed by any married woman who shall have sexual intercourse with a “man” not her husband.

Killing a child of tender age is held to be attended by treachery.\n\nFely is not liable for any crime. Fely did not participate in the actual killing of the child, and it was not shown that there is conspiracy nor community of design to commit murder since her criminal intention\n\npertains to kidnapping for ransom.  Moreover, her participation of demanding ransom for the release of the child is not connected to murder. Mens rea without actus reus is not a crime.\n\nN.B. Lina is not guilty of kidnapping with murder because the child was not deprived of liberty. The child was essentially not deprived of liberty. The demand for ransom did not convert the offense into kidnapping. The demand for ransom is only a part of the diabolic scheme of the defendant to murder the child, to conceal his body and then demand money before the discovery of the cadaver.\n\n"

B)  Offender killing his illegitimate grandson.\nC)  Offender killing his common-law wife. D) Offender killing his illegitimate mother.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nD. Parricide is committed when: (1) a person is killed; (2) the deceased is killed by the accused; (3) the deceased is the father, mother, or child, whether legitimate or illegitimate, or a legitimate other ascendant or other descendant, or the legitimate spouse of the accused (People v. Tibon, GR No. 188320, June 29,\n2010). Killing his granddaughter, grandson or wife shall not be considered as parricide since the\nrelationship is not legitimate. In parricide, the legitimacy of the relationship is an essential element thereof\nif the victim is the wife or the second-degree direct relative of the offender. Hence, “A”, “B” or “C” is not the answer. On the other hand, killing his illegitimate mother is parricide.

    "text": "229.\tExplain and illustrate the stages of execution of the crime of homicide, taking into account the nature of the offense, the essential element of each of the stages of execution and the manner of committing such international felony as distinguished from felony committed through reckless imprudence. (2012 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nElements of the crime – homicide as an intentional felony has three stages, attempted, frustrated and consummated. In whatever stages homicide is committed, intent to kill must be established for being an indispensable element thereof. However, if the victim died as a consequence of wound cause by an act committed with malice, intent to kill in conclusively presumed and the crime committed is consummated homicide. But if the victim did not die as a consequence of wounds cause by an act committed with malice, intent to kill must be established beyond reasonable doubt. If intent to kill is proven, the crime committed is frustrated or attempted homicide. If intent to kill is not proven, the crime committed is physical injuries. Thus, lack of intent to kill is a defense in attempted or frustrated homicide.\n\nNature of the crime – if the offender with intent to kill attempted to inflict or inflicted non-mortal wounds upon the victim, he already directly commenced an overt act to commit homicide. Hence, the crime committed is attempted homicide if he failed to inflict mortal wounds upon the victim by reason of some cause or accident other than his own spontaneous desistance. If the offender with intent to kill inflicted mortal wounds upon the victim, he already performed all acts of execution which would have produced the homicide as a consequence. If death is not produced despite the mortal character of the wounds due to causes independent to the will of the offender, the crime committed is frustrated homicide. If death is produced, the crime committed is consummated homicide.\n\nIntentional felony and culpable felony – homicide regardless of stages must be committed with malice (general intent) and intent to kill (specific intent). Even if there is no intent to kill and evil intent, the offender is liable for culpable felony if the victim died or injured as a result of the recklessness of the former. If there is no intent to kill, evil intent and recklessness on the part of the accused, he is not liable for his intentional act, which cause the death of or injury upon the victim because of the exempting circumstance of accident.\n\n"

What is its rationale? What is the effect of failure to observe the requirement?

Incensed, Razzy called Max to help him beat Angelina. The beatings that Angelina received eventually caused her death. What crime or crimes, if any, were committed? Explain. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nRazzy is liable for kidnapping with homicide. Since Angelino was killed in the course of the detention, the crime constitutes kidnapping with homicide under Article 267 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nThe abduction of Angelino could not be forcible abduction since the victim must be a woman. Similarly, there is no rape through sexual intercourse since Angelino remains to be male.\n\nThere is also no rape through sexual assault because Razzy neither inserted his penis into the anal orifice or mouth of Angelino nor another instrument or object into anal orifice or genital orifice. The act constitutes acts of lasciviousness under Article 336 which was committed by reason or occasion of kidnapping.

Lucio was not around when the sexual assaults took place as he left after bringing his colleagues and Mildred to their destination, but he returned every day to bring food and the news in town about Mildred's disappearance. For five days, Felipe, Julio and Roldan kept Mildred in the house and took turns in sexually assaulting her. On the 6th day, Mildred managed to escape; she proceeded immediately to the nearest police station and narrated her ordeal.\n\nWhat crime/s did  Felipe, Julio, Roldan, and  Lucio commit and  what  was their  degree of participation? (2013 Bar Question)\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nFelipe, Julio, Roldan and Lucio are all liable for the special complex crime of Kidnapping and Serious Illegal Detention with Rape. In a special complex crime of Kidnapping with Rape, the resultant crime is only one kidnapping and serious illegal detention with rape regardless of the number of rapes committed.\n\nAs to the degree of their participation, Felipe, Julio, Roldan and Lucio are all liable as principals. There was implied conspiracy as they acted toward a single criminal design or purpose. (People vs. Mirandilla, Jr., GR\n186417, July 27, 2011). Although Lucio was not around when the sexual assaults took place, there is\ncomplicity on his part as he was the one who drove the tricycle at the time the victim was seized and he returned every day to bring food and news to his conspirators.\n\n"

Explain.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Tristan is liable for Estafa through Misappropriation under Article 315 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nHe received the cows under obligation to return the same thing, and acquired legal or juridical possession in so doing, being a commodatum, and when he sold the cows as if he owned it, constitutes misappropriation or conversion.\n\nDomingo is liable for qualified theft under Article 308 of the Revised Penal Code.\n\nB)  Although Tristan received the horse with the consent of the owner Hannibal, his possession is merely physical or de facto.

Rule on the defense of Mr. Gray.\nB)  Mr. Gray claims that he was entrapped illegally because there was no showing that the second\ncheck was a forgery and, therefore, his withdrawal based on the second check was a legal act.\nIs Mr. Gray correct? SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nA)  The first defense of Mr. Gray has no merit. The law presumes that the possessor and user of a falsified document is the falsifier or forger thereof. Likewise, his second defense that Mr. White did not suffer any injuries as to the second check has no merit. Damage or intent to cause damage is not considered in attempted estafa.\n\nB)  Mr. Gray is not correct. The fact that the first check is forged justifies the entrapment of Mr. Gray since there is already probable cause that the second check is also a forgery.

B)  RR is liable for estafa by means of false pretenses.\nC)  RR is not liable for estafa because WW participated in the illegal travel documents.\nD) RR can no longer be held liable for estafa because with the dismissal of the case against him for illegal recruitment, double jeopardy has already set in.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nB. RR is liable for estafa by means of false pretense. RR misrepresented and falsely pretended that she had the capacity to deploy WW for employment in Taiwan. The misrepresentation was made prior to the payment for processing fee. As a result of RR’s false pretenses and misrepresentations, WW suffered damages as the promised employment abroad never materialized and the money she paid was never recovered.\n\nThe fact that WW actively participated in the processing of the illegal travel documents will not exculpate RR from liability. WW was forced to take part in the processing of the falsified travel documents because she had already paid the processing fee.\n\nIllegal recruitment and estafa cases may be filed simultaneously or separately. The filing of charges for illegal recruitment does not bar the filing of estafa, and vice versa.

The prosecutor is unsure whether to charge Braulio for acts of lasciviousnessunder Art. 336 of the RPC, for lascivious conduct under RA 7610 (Special Protection against Child Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act), or for rape under Art. 266-A of the RPC.

During the course of the trial, and again to the surprise of Hector, it was proved that Wendy was born male and underwent sex reassignment later in life. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nA)  May Hector's charge of adultery against Wendy and Ariel prosper?   Explain. B)  What is an impossible crime? Can there be an impossible crime of adultery?\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Yes, Hector’s charge of adultery will prosper.\n\nAdultery has the following elements: (1) the woman is married; (2) she has sexual intercourse with a man not her husband; (3) as regards the man with whom she has sexual intercourse, he must know her to be married.\n\nIn the case at hand, the discovery by Hector of the video of Wendy having sexual intercourse with another man, Ariel, is sufficient to charge his wife with Adultery. The fact that Wendy was later discovered by Hector to be born male who simply underwent sexual re-assignment later in life, is immaterial to the charge of Adultery considering that the marriage between the same sex is considered valid in the US where they were married.\n\nB)  An impossible crime is an act which would be an offense against persons or property, were it not for the inherent impossibility of its accomplishment or on account of the employment of inadequate or ineffectual means.

The chassis and motor numbers on the Fortuner were found, upon verification with the Land Transportation Office, to correspond to a vehicle previously reported as carnapped.\n\nRoberto claimed that he was in good faith; Iñigo sold him a carnapped vehicle and he did not know that he was buying a carnapped vehicle.\n\nIf you were the prosecutor, would you or would you not charge Roberto with a crime? (2013 Bar\nQuestion)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nRoberto may use the defense that he is a buyer in good faith is based on his reliance on the “deed of sale”\nexecuted by Inigo with attached copy of the “Registration Certificate.”\n\nConsequently, in light of the satisfactory explanation of Roberto of his possession of the vehicle, the presumption of authorship of the theft upon a person found in possession of the stolen personal property finds no application in the instant case.\n\nThere is, thus, no probable cause or evidence to warrant the prosecution of Roberto for any wrongdoing, even for the offense of fencing.\n\n"

Why or why not? (2010 Bar Question) SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo, the charge of “fencing” will not prosper. “Fencing” is committed when a person, with intent to gain for himself or for another, deals in any manner with an article of value which he knows or should be known to him to have been derived from the proceeds of theft or robbery (Sec. 2, PD 1612). Thus, for a charge of fencing to prosper, it must first be established that theft or robbery of the article subject of the alleged “fencing” has been committed.

He gave 50% of that amount to Governor Datu, the official who had signed the contract with the proper authorization from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan; 25% to Bokal Diva, the Sangguniang Panlalawigan member  who  had  lobbied  for  the  award  of  the  project  in  the  Sangguniang Panlalawigan; 25% to Mayor Dolor of the Municipality where the project would be implemented. Governor Datu received his share through his wife, Provincial First Lady Dee, who then deposited the amount in her personal bank account.\n\nPreviously, upon facilitation by the Bokal Diva, Mr. Gangnam concluded an agreement with Mayor Dolor for the construction of the Blank Sports Arena worth P800 Million. The project was highly overpriced because it could be undertaken and completed for not more than P400 Million. For this project, Mayor Dolor received from Mr. Gangnam a gift of P10 Million, while Bokal Diva got P25 Million.\n\nIn both instances, Bokal Diva had her gifts deposited in the name of her secretary, Terry, who personally maintained a bank account for Bokal Diva’s share in government projects. (2017 Bar Question)\n\nA)  May each of the above-named individuals be held liable for plunder? Explain your answer. SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nNo, Governor Datu is not liable for plunder.\n\nTo be held liable for plunder, the pubic officer must amass, accumulate or acquire ill-gotten wealth through a combination or series of overt or criminal acts. The word “combination” means at least two different predicate crimes; while the term “series” means at least two predicate crimes of the same kind. A single predicate crime amounting to 50 million pesos is not plunder.\n\nThe act of receiving P50 Million by Governor Datu in connection with any government contract or project for the development of an economic and tourism hub is a predicate crime of plunder.\n\nAs regards, Mayor Dolor Kickback, the series acts of receiving by or gift in the amount of P25 million and P10 million in connection with any government contract or project for the development of an economic and tourism hub and for the construction of the Blank Sports Arena, respectively, are predicate crimes of plunder. However, the aggregate amount of ill-gotten wealth acquired is less than P50 million. Hence,\n\nplunder is not committed since element that the aggregate amount of ill-gotten wealth is at least P50 million is not present.\n\nBokal Diva is liable for plunder because he acquired ill-gotten wealth in the aggregate amount of P50 million through a series of predicates crimes consisting of receipts of kickback or gift in the amount of P25 million and P25 million in connection with any government contract or project for the development of an economic and tourism hub and for the construction of the Blank Sports Arena, respectively.\n\nMr. Gangnam, is liable for plunder for giving kickbacks to Bokal Diva, and Terry for depositing the money in his account for Bokal Diva are also liable for plunder. Under RA No. 7080, any person who participated with the said public officer in the commission of an offense contributing to the crime of plunder shall likewise be punished for such offense.\n\nB)  Define wheel conspiracy and chain conspiracy.   Is either or both kinds existent herein?\nExplain your answer.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nIn the case at bar, both type of conspiracy exists. The distribution of commissions or gifts by Mr. Gangnam and the acceptance of Governor Datu, Bokal Diva, Mayor Dolor is a type of wheel conspiracy where a single person, Mr. Gangnam, dealt individually with the public officials to commit the overt acts. The chain conspiracy, on the other hand, is evident in the overpricing of the sports complex through the facilitation of Bokal Diva, the conclusion of the agreements by Mayor Dolor, and the distribution of the gifts by Mr. Gangnam.\n\nC)  What provisions of RA no. 3019 (Anti-Graft & Corrupt Practices Act), if any, were violated by any of the above-named individuals, specifying the persons liable therefore? Explain your answer.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nGovernor Datu, Mayor Dolor and Bokal Diva are liable for violation of Section 3 (b) of RA No. 3019 for receiving money in connection with government contract or transaction for the development of an economic and tourism hub where they have the right to intervene under the law. Likewise, Mr. Gangnam, is also liable for violation of Section 3 (b) of RA No. 3019 on the basis of conspiracy.\n\nMayor Dolor and Bokal Diva are liable for violation of Section 3 (b) of RA No. 3019 for receiving money in connection with government contract or transaction for the construction of the Blank Sports Arena or violation of Section 3 (e) for giving Mr. Gangnam, a private party, unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference through manifest partiality and evident bad faith by entering an agreement for such construction, which is highly overpriced, or violation of Section 3 (g) for entering, on behalf of the Government, into any contract or transaction for such construction manifestly and grossly disadvantageous to the same. Likewise, Mr. Gangnam for giving money to the said public officers or for entering such contract is also liable for violation of Section 3(b) of RA No. 3019 on the basis of conspiracy.\n\nD) What crimes under the Revised Penal Code, if any, were committed, specifying the persons liable therefor? Explain your answer.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nGovernor Datu, Mayor Dolor and Bokal Diva are liable for indirect bribery under Art. 211, RPC for receiving money from Mr. Gangnam.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Gangnam is liable for corruption of public officer under Article 212 of the RPC because of his act of giving gifts to the public officers.\n\n"

Under Article 89 of the Revised Penal Code, criminal liability is totally extinguished by amnesty, which completely extinguishes the penalty and all its effects.

    "text": "351.Romeo and Julia have been married for twelve (12) years and had two (2) children. The first few years of their marriage went along smoothly. However, on the fifth year onwards, they would often quarrel when Romeo comes home drunk. The quarrels became increasingly violent, marked by quiet periods when Julia would leave the conjugal dwelling. During these times of quiet, Romeo would \"court\" Julia with flowers and chocolate and convince her to return home, telling her that he could not live without her; or Romeo would ask Julia to forgive him, which she did, believing that if she humbled herself, Romeo would change. After a month of marital bliss, Romeo would return to his drinking habit and the quarrel would start again, verbally at first, until it would escalate to physical violence.\n\nOne night, Romeo came home drunk and went straight to bed. Fearing the onset of another violent fight, Julia stabbed Romeo while he was asleep. A week later, their neighbors discovered Romeo's rotting corpse on the marital bed. Julia and the children were nowhere to be found. Julia was charged with parricide. She asserted \"battered woman's syndrome\" as her defense. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nExplain the \"cycle of violence.\" SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nThe battered woman syndrome is characterized by the so-called “cycle of violence,” which has three phases: (1) the tension-building phase; (2) the acute battering incident; and (3) the tranquil, loving (or, at least, nonviolent) phase.\n\nDuring the tension-building phase, minor battering occurs – it could be verbal or slight physical abuse or another form of hostile behavior. The woman tries to pacify the batterer through a kind, nurturing behavior; or by simply staying out of his way. The acute battering incident is characterized by brutality, destructiveness and, sometimes, death. The battered woman deems this incident as unpredictable, yet also inevitable. During this phase, she has no\n\ncontrol; only the batterer may put an end to the violence.  The final phase of the cycle of violence begins when the acute battering incident ends. During this tranquil period, the couple experience profound relief.\n\nIs Julia's \"battered woman's syndrome\" defense meritorious? Explain. SUGGESTED ANSWER:\nYes. The defense of Battered Woman Syndrome can be invoked if the woman in marital relationship with the\nvictim is subjected to cumulative abuse or battery involving the infliction of physical harm resulting to the physical and psychological or emotional distress. (People v. Genosa, G.R. No. 135981, 15 January 2004). RA No. 9262 states that Battered Woman Syndrome is a defense notwithstanding the absence of any of the elements for justifying circumstances of self-defense under the Revised Penal Code such as unlawful aggression (Section 26 of RA No. 9262).\n\nIn this case, because of the battering episodes, Julia, feared the onset of another violent fight and honestly believed the need to defend herself even if Romeo had not commenced an unlawful aggression.    Even in the absence of unlawful aggression, Battered Woman Syndrome is a defense.\n\n"

Explain.\nB)  Will your answer be the same, assuming that Talia killed Dion after being beaten up after a\nsecond time?  Explain.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  No, a single act of battery or physical harm committed by Dion against Talia resulting to the physical and psychological or emotional distress on her part is not sufficient to avail of the benefit of the justifying circumstance of “Battered Women Syndrome”.\n\nThe defense of Battered Woman Syndrome can be invoked if the woman with marital relationship with the victim is subjected to cumulative abuse or battery involving the infliction of physical harm resulting to the physical and psychological or emotional distress. Cumulative means resulting from successive addition. In sum, there must be “at least two battering episodes” between the accused and her intimate partner and such final episode produced in the battered person’s mind an actual fear of an imminent harm from her batterer and an honest belief that she needed to use force in order to save her life (People v. Genosa, G.R. No. 135981, January 15, 2004).\n\nB)  Yes, Talia can invoke the defense of Battered Woman Syndrome to free herself from criminal liability for killing her husband since she suffered physical and emotional distress arising from cumulative abuse or battery, Under Section 26 of RA 9262, victim survivors of Battered Woman Syndrome do not incur any criminal or civil liability despite the absence of the requisites of self-defense.\n\n"

There, Solito succeeded in having carnal knowledge of Maita against her will.\n\nMeanwhile, the police authorities were tipped off that at 11:30 p.m. on that same night Solito would be selling marijuana outside the green-painted house.  Acting on the tip, the PNP station of the town formed a buy-bust team with PO2 Masahol being designated the poseur buyer. During the buy-bust operation Solito opened the trunk of the Toyota Innova to retrieved the bag of marijuana to be sold to PO2 Masahol. To cut the laces that he had tied the bag with, Solito took out a swiss knife, but his doing so prompted PO2 Masahol to effect his immediate arrest out of fear that he would attack him with the knife.  PO2 Masahol then confiscated the bag of marijuana as well as the Toyota Innova. (2017 Bar Question)\n\nA)  Two informations were filed against Solito in the RTC – one for forcible abduction with rape, raffled to Branch 8 of the RTC; the other for illegal sale of drugs, assigned to Branch 29 of the RTC. Was Solito charged with the proper offenses based on the circumstances? Explain your answer.\nB)  While the Prosecution was presenting its evidence in Branch 29, Branch 8 convicted Solito.\nImmediately after the judgment of conviction was promulgated, Solito filed in both Branches a motion for the release of the Toyota Innova.   He argued and proved that he had only borrowed the vehicle from his brother, the registered owner. Branch 8 granted the motion but\nBranch 29 denied it. Were the two courts correct in their rulings? Explain your answer.\n\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Solito should have been charged of rape. Rape absorbs forcible abduction where the accused intended at the very outset to rape the victim when he abducted her (People v. San Pedro, G.R. No. 94128, 3\nFebruary 1993).\n\nOn the hand, the charge of sale of dangerous drugs is improper, since this crime is consummated only upon the delivery of the dangerous drugs to the poseur buyer for a consideration. In this case, Solito has not yet delivered the marijuana to PO2 Masahol when the latter apprehended the former, the crime committed is not sale of dangerous drugs but attempted sale of dangerous drugs.\n\nB)  Yes. The two courts were correct in their rulings.\n\nArticle 45 of the Revised Penal Code provides that every penalty imposed for the commission of a felony shall include the forfeiture of the instruments or tools with which the crime was committed, unless they be the property of a third person not liable for the offense.\n\nLikewise, the return of the instrument or tools to its owner cannot be prevented unless said owner is charged with the offense for which said instrument or tool was used. [PDEA v. Brodett, (G.R. No.\n196390, 28 September 2011, citing People v. Jose, G.R. No. L-28232, Feb. 6, 1971)].  The Supreme Court further held that the forfeiture of said instrument or tools, if warranted, would be part of the penalty prescribed (PDEA v. Brodett, supra). Hence, the determination of whether it will be forfeited could be made only when judgment is rendered.\n\nIn this case, the RTC Branch 8 already rendered a judgment of conviction against Solito and he was able to prove that the car belonged to his brother. Hence, it was correct for the RTC Branch 8 to order the release of the Toyota Innova to his brother who is not liable for the offense.\n\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court ruled that it is premature to release the car used in the sale of dangerous drugs while the trial is still ongoing (PDEA v. Brodett, supra) and explained that the status of the car for the duration of the trial as being in custodia legis is primarily intended to preserve it as evidence and to ensure its availability as such (PDEA v. Brodett, supra).\n\nThus, RTC Branch 29, was correct in denying Solito’s motion to release the Toyota Innova considering\nthat the trial for illegal sale of drugs is still ongoing.\n\n\n"

    "text": "358.\tDimas was arrested after a valid buy-bust operation. Macario, the policeman who acted as poseur- buyer, inventoried and photographed ten (10) sachets of shabu in the presence of a barangay tanod. The inventory was signed by Macario and the tanod, but Dimas refused to sign. As Macario was stricken with flu the day after, he was able to surrender the sachets to the PNP Crime Laboratory only after four (4) days. During pre-trial, the counsel de officio of Dimas stipulated that the substance contained in the sachets examined by the forensic chemist is in fact methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu. Dimas was convicted of violating Section 5 of RA 9165. On appeal, Dimas questioned the admissibility of the evidence because Macario failed to observe the requisite \"chain of custody\" of the alleged \"shabu\" seized from him. On behalf of the State, the Solicitor General claimed that despite non-compliance with some requirements, the prosecution was able to show that the integrity of the substance was preserved. Moreover, even with some deviations from the requirements, the counsel of Dimas stipulated that the substance seized from Dimas was shabu so that the conviction should be affirmed. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nA)  What is the \"chain of custody\" requirement in drug offenses? B)  Rule on the contention of the State.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  To establish the chain of custody, the prosecution must show the movements of the dangerous drugs from its confiscation up to its presentation in court. The purpose of establishing the chain of custody is to ensure the integrity of the corpus delicti (People v. Magat, G.R. No. 179939, 29 September 2008).   The following links that must be established in the chain of custody in a buy-bust situation are: first, the seizure and marking, if practicable, of the illegal drug recovered from the accused by the apprehending officer; second, the turnover of the illegal drug seized by the apprehending officer to the investigating officer; third, the turnover by the investigating officer of the illegal drug to the forensic chemist for laboratory examination; and fourth, the turnover and submission of the marked illegal drug seized from the forensic chemist to the court (People v. Kamad, G.R. No. 174198, 19 January 2010).\n\nTo establish the first link in the chain of custody, and that is the seizure of the drug from the accused, the prosecution must comply with Section 21 of RA No. 9165, which requires that the apprehending officer after the confiscation of drug must immediately physically inventory and photograph the same in the presence of the accused or the person from whom such items were confiscated, or his representative or counsel, a representative from the media and the Department of Justice (DOJ), and any elected public official who shall be required to sign the copies of the inventory and be given a copy thereof and within twenty-four (24) hours upon such confiscation, the drug shall be submitted to the PDEA Forensic Laboratory for examination.\n\nB)  Yes, the contention of the State is meritorious. Failure to strictly comply with Section 21(1), Article II of R.A.\nNo. 9165 does not necessarily render an accused's arrest illegal or the items seized or confiscated from him inadmissible. The most important factor is the preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item. Moreover, the issue of non-compliance with Section 21 of RA No. 9165 cannot be raised for the first\ntime on appeal (People v. Badilla, G.R. No. 218578, August 31, 2016).\n\nHere, Macario, the policeman failed to comply with Section 21 of RA No 9165 since the inventory and photograph of the drugs was only made in the presence of barangay tanod and the same was not submitted to the PNP Crime Laboratory within 24 hours. However, the failure to strictly comply with Section 21 of R.A. No. 9165 does not necessarily render the items seized or confiscated inadmissible since there was preservation of the integrity and evidentiary value of the seized item. Thus, the contention of the State is meritorious.\n\n"

    "text": "359.\tThe Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) had intelligence reports about the drug pushing activities of Rado, but could not arrest him for lack of concrete evidence. SP03 Relio, a PDEA team leader, approached Ernilo and requested him to act as poseur-buyer of shabu and transact with Rado. Ernilo refused, saying that he had completely been rehabilitated and did not want to have anything to do with drugs anymore. But he was prevailed upon to help when SP03\nRelio explained that only he could help capture Rado because he used to be his customer. SP03\nRelio then gave Ernilo the marked money to be used in buying shabu from Rado. The operation proceeded. After Ernilo handed the marked money to Rado in exchange for the sachets of shabu\nweighing 50 grams, and upon receiving the pre-arranged signal from Ernilo, SP03 Relio and his team members barged in and arrested Rado and Ernilo, who were both charged with violation of R.A. 9165, otherwise known as the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002. (2015 Bar Question)\n\nA)  What defense, if any, may Ernilo invoke to free himself from criminal liability? Explain. B)  May Rado adopt as his own Ernilo's defense? Explain.\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA)  Ernilo may invoke Section 33, Art. II, RA 9165 or the “Comprehensive Drugs Act of 2002.” He may have violated Section 11 of RA 9165 for possession of shabu but he is immune from prosecution and punishment because of his role as the poseur-buyer in the entrapment operation.\n\nB)  No. First, an entrapment operation is a valid means of arresting violators of RA 9165. It is an effective way of apprehending law offenders in the act of committing a crime. In a buy-bust operation, the idea to commit a crime originates from the offender, without anybody inducing or prodding him to commit the offense. Second, the immunity does not extend to violators of Section 5 of RA 9165 or the sale of shabu (sec. 33, RA 9165). Lastly, he was the offender of the crime and the most guilty of the offense.\n\n"

On appeal, Tommy questioned the admissibility of the evidence because the police officers who conducted the buy-bust operation failed to observe the requisite \"chain of custody\" of the evidence confiscated and/or seized from him.\n\nWhat is the \"chain of custody\" requirement in drug offenses? What is its rationale? What is the effect of failure to observe the requirement? (2009 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nThe chain of custody requirement in drug offense refers to the duly recorded, authorized movement and custody of seized dangerous drugs, controlled chemicals, plant sources of dangerous drugs, and laboratory equipment of dangerous drugs from the time confiscation/seizure thereof from the offender, to its turn- over and receipt in the forensic laboratory for examination to its safekeeping and eventual presentation/offer in court as evidence of the criminal violation, and for destruction (Dangerous Drugs Board Regulation No. 1 Series of 2002).\n\nIts rationale is to preserve the authenticity of the corpus delicti or body of the crime by rendering it improbable that the original item seized/confiscated in violation has been exchanged or substituted with\n\nanother or tampered with or contaminated. It is a method of authenticating the evidence as would support a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the matter is what the prosecution claims to be.\n\nFailure to observe the “chain of custody” requirement renders the evidence questionable, not trustworthy and insufficient to prove the corpus delicti beyond reasonable doubt.

Explain. (2016 Bar Question)\n\nSUGGESTED ANSWER:\n\nA is guilty of carnapping.\n\nThe concept of carnapping is the same as that of robbery and theft. Hence, rules applicable to theft or robbery are also applicable to carnapping (People v. Asamuddin, G.R. No. 213913, 2 September 2015). In theft, unlawful taking should be understood within the Spanish concept of apoderamiento. In order to constitute apoderamiento, the physical taking must be coupled with the intent to appropriate the object, which means intent deprive the lawful owner of the thing, whether permanently or temporarily (People v. Valenzuela, G. R. No. 160188, 21 June 2007).\n\nIn this case, A took the car without consent of the B, with intent to temporarily deprive him of the car. Although the taking was \"temporary\" and for a \"joy ride\", the Supreme Court in People v. Bustinera (supra), held that when a person, either with the object of going to a certain place, or learning how to drive, or enjoying a free ride, takes possession of a vehicle belonging to another, without the consent of its owner, is guilty of theft because by taking possession of the personal property belonging to another and using it, his intent to gain is evident since he derives therefrom utility, satisfaction, enjoyment and pleasure.\n\n"
